- What do AI responses look like?
  - It depends on the request that was made.

Enum for requests
-----------------
- We need an enum for requests.
  - PLAY, KICKOFF etc


Play
----
- Most of the game is in the 'play' state
- We send a snapshot of the state of play.
- AIs send back *intentions*
  - Player number
  - Action (move, turn etc)
  - Other data that goes with the action

{
   "messageType":"REQUEST",
   "request":"PLAY",
   "actions":[
      {
         "playerNumber":6,
         "action":"MOVE",
         "destination":{
            "x":40.3,
            "y":20.2
         },
         "speed":80.0
      },
      {
         "playerNumber":7,
         "action":"TURN",
         "direction":220.4
      }
   ]
}

- Q: Where should this be parsed?
  - The current state checks the request.
