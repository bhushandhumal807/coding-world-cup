Movement
--------
- How does movement work?

- The player has a destination and a direction.

- The player always moves in the direction they are facing.
  And then turns towards the destination.
  - Even if this is in the opposite direction to the destination?
  - I wonder if this might mean that you go round in circles
    and never get to the destination.

- Alternatively, the player first turns.
  - And then moves when facing the right direction.
