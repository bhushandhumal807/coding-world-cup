TODO: Method to set direction in degrees

TODO: Method to set direction facing a destination

TODO: Decide whether speed & kicking strength decreases as energy goes down. Or it could remain at full strength until energy runs out.

TODO: If speed goes down with energy, then need to calculate energy (and thus speed) at start and end of a calculation interval and "integrate".

TODO: Have a parameter for rate of energy decrease. So simple tests will set this to 0 to make the calculations easier.

TODO: With energy decrease, distance is just the average using speed@start and speed@end.

TODO: Make sure you can't score a goal by hitting it diagonally by the side of the goal, but so that it ends up behind the goal. In this case, it should have bounced off the side earlier.
TODO: So we should make an "accurate" bounce, where we find the intersection of the ball's path with the border of the pitch, and "reflect" from there.

TODO: Think about timeouts for AI responses

TODO: Add processing time allowances to the Teams. Process in GSM_Base??

TODO: Rename Intentions to Actions?

TODO: Some intentions reset to None once complete. KICK, maybe also TURN. Maybe all do?

TODO: Do not allow players within (10 metres?) of the goal

TODO: Only allow the goalkeeper to hold the ball for 5 seconds

TODO: When the goalkeeper has the ball, he cannot be tackled

TODO: Check that players do not go into the goal circle, and that the goalkeeper doesn't go outside

TODO: Add fouling to tackling

TODO: Is tackling broken? Should it be related to distance? If you fail to tackle, should there be a time limit before you can tackle again? Otherwise a tackling player will more-or-less always eventually get the ball.
