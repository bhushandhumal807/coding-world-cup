TODO: Method to set direction in degrees

TODO: Method to set direction facing a destination

TODO: Decide whether speed & kicking strength decreases as energy goes down. Or it could remain at full strength until energy runs out.

TODO: If speed goes down with energy, then need to calculate energy (and thus speed) at start and end of a calculation interval and "integrate".

TODO: Have a parameter for rate of energy decrease. So simple tests will set this to 0 to make the calculations easier.

TODO: With energy decrease, distance is just the average using speed@start and speed@end.

TODO: Think about timeouts for AI responses

TODO: Add processing time allowances to the Teams. Process in GSM_Base??

TODO: Do not allow players within (10 metres?) of the goal

TODO: Only allow the goalkeeper to hold the ball for 5 seconds

TODO: Check that players do not go into the goal circle, and that the goalkeeper doesn't go outside

TODO: Add fouling to tackling

TODO: Is tackling broken? Should it be related to distance? If you fail to tackle, should there be a time limit before you can tackle again? Otherwise a tackling player will more-or-less always eventually get the ball.

TODO: Try to avoid timewasting. Can't pass back and forth with the goalkeeper

TODO: Some notes on wiki about how to debug AIs.

TODO: Validate movement of players in game loop
TODO: RandomMovement should keep goalkeepers in their areas, and players outside.
TODO: OR: movement should fail if a player moves to an invalid position.
