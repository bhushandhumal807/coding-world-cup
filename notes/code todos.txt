TODO: Decide whether speed & kicking strength decreases as energy goes down. Or it could remain at full strength until energy runs out.

TODO: If speed goes down with energy, then need to calculate energy (and thus speed) at start and end of a calculation interval and "integrate".

TODO: Have a parameter for rate of energy decrease. So simple tests will set this to 0 to make the calculations easier.

TODO: With energy decrease, distance is just the average using speed@start and speed@end.

TODO: Think about timeouts for AI responses

TODO: Add processing time allowances to the Teams. Process in GSM_Base??

TODO: Only allow the goalkeeper to hold the ball for 5 seconds

TODO: Add fouling to tackling

TODO: Is tackling broken? Should it be related to distance? If you fail to tackle, should there be a time limit before you can tackle again? Otherwise a tackling player will more-or-less always eventually get the ball.

TODO: Try to avoid timewasting. Can't pass back and forth with the goalkeeper

TODO: Some notes on wiki about how to debug AIs.

TODO: Do something if the ball hasn't moved for some time (10 sec?) This could happen, for example, if the ball is in the goal area, and the goalkeeper doesn't take possession.

TODO: log real time in cwc
