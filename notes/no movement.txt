- If there has been no movement (or hardly any) for a while, I think we
  should move the ball automatically.

- Some combinations of AIs seem to get in a state where they cluster around the
  ball, and it ends up not moving. Maybe it just gets passed between the players
  who are all in the same place.

- So the ball may move a little.

- We want to check something like the maximum movement in the last X seconds.

- Not just how far the ball is now from where it was X seconds ago - as it may
  have moved somewhere and then moved back again.
