Merge take possession and tackling
----------------------------------
- Huw suggested it, and it seems like a good idea!

- You issue the TAKE_POSSESSION action

- The rules about 5m still apply.

- It means that if a player kicks the ball, you will try to get it.
  - Instead of having to switch between tacke and take-possession actions.
