Kickoff
-------

- All actions set to NONE

- We send a kickoff request to each team

- "request":"KICKOFF"
- "team1":(state, including direction)
- "team2":(state, including direction)
- "team":"team1" or "team2"

- Response
- "request":"KICKOFF"
- "positions":[{"playerNumber":(value), position:{"x":(value), "y":(value), "direction":(value)}, ...]

- We then *validate* the positions
  - Players must be in their own half
  - Non-kicking team must be outside the centre circle
  - If they are not valid, we use default positions

- We then go to the PLAY state.




AIs get:
- PLAY request
- GOAL event
- KICKOFF request
- START_OF_TURN event, with default positions
