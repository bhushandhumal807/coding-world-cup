Configuring abilities
---------------------
- REQUEST near start of game
  - At start of game or start of tournament?
  - Game makes sense, as you know the player numbers then.
  - Also, it could be that you are fielding a different team for each game.

- "request":"CONFIGURE_ABILITIES"
  - "totalKickingAbility":(value)
  - "totalRunningAbility":(value)
  - "totalBallControlAbility":(value)
  - "totalTacklingAbility":(value)

- Is this a GSM-state?
  - Yes
  - Waits for abilities, then moves to Kickoff

- What's the response?
  - [players], where each player is:
  - {playerNumber, kickingAbility, runningAbility, ballControlAbility, tacklingAbility}
