- How does kicking work?

- We apply a random offset to the requested _angle_ based on
  1. passingAbility
  2. angle away from the direction the player is facing

- So maybe two random factors - one for each of the points above.

- passingAbility
  - 100 = no deviation
  - 0   = deviation up to (180 degrees * random factor)

- Deviations can be plus or minus
  - So 20 degrees, means rand() * 40 - 20

- angle away from player direction
  - If angle is 180 degrees, deviation = (20 degrees * random factor)

- How does the random thing work
  - Especially for mocking?
  - Random class in utils
  - Player holds one
    - Can be replaced with Mock version
