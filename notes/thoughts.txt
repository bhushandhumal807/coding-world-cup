Power ups
---------
- The game could have power-ups that randomly appear. They could give you:
  - Extra stamina
  - Extra speed
  - Extra skill
  - New abilities, e.g. bend-it-like-Beckham


How many players?
-----------------
- Too many might make it hard to see things in a GUI.
- So five or six players?
- Let's say five.


Skills & abilities
------------------
- Passing accuracy
- Curl "Bend it like Beckham"
- Ball control (controlling a ball passed to you or intercepted)
- Tackling
- Speed
- Stamina


Initial allocation of abilities
-------------------------------
- 100 points in each ability


Size of the pitch
-----------------
- The goal should be wider than the sum of the players!
  - Even if the players are spread out, the ball should be able to get through to the goal.

Cheats
------
- Fouling
- Diving
- Biting
- The Hand of God


Sprint
------
- Ability to sprint for a short while (quite limited) which drains energy faster
- A way to break away from a marker.


Marking

- Is there anything to stop them just sticking together?
  - (What stops this in real football?)
