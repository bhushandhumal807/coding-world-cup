Energy
------
- Energy should decrease as the square of speed?
  - Or at least, greater than linear.
  - If there is a linear relationship, then it is just as sensible
    to run fast as slow.
    - Well, sort-of. You do still use up energy that you may need later.

Power ups
---------
- The game could have power-ups that randomly appear. They could give you:
  - Extra stamina
  - Extra speed
  - Extra skill
  - New abilities, e.g. bend-it-like-Beckham


How many players?
-----------------
- Too many might make it hard to see things in a GUI.
- So five or six players?
- Let's say five.


API / interaction thoughts
--------------------------
- AIs set a destination for each player, and the speed they want to move at
  - Speed depends on their speed-ability and on their energy.


Skills & abilities
------------------
- Passing accuracy
- Curl "Bend it like Beckham"
- Ball control (controlling a ball passed to you or intercepted)
- Tackling
- Speed
- Stamina
- Turning speed (A more general 'agility' ability? Would it be used for anything else?)


Initial allocation of abilities
-------------------------------
- 100 points in each ability
- Is this enough? 
  - Even distribution would give 20 points in each ability to each player.
  - If 100 = perfect ability (e.g passing) then an average of 20% would be too low.
- Answer: The 100 total (per ability) can be changed.
  - So 100 = 100% accuracy
- Less accuracy could make the games more interesting.
  - More random anyway. Not sure whether this is good or bad.
  - Even so: ability counts for something overall.


Passing accuracy
----------------
- 100% (100 points) accuracy means 


Turning
-------
- Players are facing in a direction
- When they want to run in a direction they must turn first
- This takes some time, depending on their agility
- For passing and shooting, there could be an option to do so without turning.
  - This reduces the accuracy, depending on the angle.


Size of the pitch
-----------------
- The goal should be wider than the sum of the players!
  - Even if the players are spread out, the ball should be able to get through to the goal.
- Size in "units"
- Should we store values as doubles or integers?
  - Doubles would be easier for calculations.
- For the game it will be 100m x 50m

Cheats
------
- Fouling
- Diving
- Biting
- The Hand of God
- They all give you some advantage, if you get away with them.

Hard tackle
-----------
- When tackling a player, you have the option to specify a hard tackle.
  - This gives you a greater chance of getting the ball.
  - But also gives a greater chance of committing a foul.


Fouls
-----
- Deliberate fouls using the fouling API
- Bashing into another player
  - Not quite sure how to decide which player is guilty
- Impeding progress



Sprint
------
- Ability to sprint for a short while (quite limited) which drains energy faster
- A way to break away from a marker.


Marking
-------
- How do we stop people just marking others incredibly closely?
- Is there anything to stop them just sticking together?
  - (What stops this in real football?)
- This will be ok
  - Because AIs see the current position every second, so there is a one second reaction time
  - Also, players will have different speeds.


Controlling destinations / intentions
-------------------------------------
- Should the API let AIs control the "intention" of each player
  - Its destination and action
- Or should AIs control the second-by-second action of each player
  - e.g. Run in X direction at Y speed
  - This seems better
- How will tackling work?
  - It may be impossible to tackle without "intention"
  - If it was just "tackle in X direction" you would most likely miss.
  - On the other hand, if you can just say "tackle player 3" at any time, this is too easy.
  - So maybe you can say "tackle player 3"
    - But only if you are close to them.


Changing direction
------------------
- When you say to run in a certain direction at a certain speed, what happens if you are not 
  currently facing that direction?
  - 1: You first turn (which takes an amount of time depending on your agility)
  - 2: You turn as you move.

- For 2: You always move in the direction you are facing, at your current speed.
  - You turn at your turning speed.
  - So you move in an arc.
  - I rather like this.    


Physics 10x faster than AI updates?
-----------------------------------
- We need to make sure we detect collisions.
  - Ball -->   <-- Player
  - If they are going too fast, then they could "go through" each other, if we
    don't check often enough.
  - (Or we could try to be clever!)
  - If we know the maximum speed of the ball and players, then we know the max combined speed.
    So we can make sure we calculate fast enough to ensure collision detection.
  
What gets passed to AIs? 
------------------------
- Is it OK to pass all player-state to AIs?
  - Or should some state be private?
  - Particularly the "intentions"?
    - Maybe it's OK to show intentions?
	- Opponents only see this one second after it's happened (ie, in the next turn)
	- Intentions only happen when a player is close to the action.

- We could have a serialize() method on PlayerState
  - This can choose which parts of the object to serialize if we decide to keep some parts private


Game of two halves?
-------------------
- Should we have two halves to the game, where you switch ends half way through?
  - In one sense there's no point.
  - In another, it means that AIs have to cope with this.
  - Also: allows for a great deal of recovery of players
    - Though maybe not to full strength.
    - Energy could go up by (say) 50% of max energy.
    - So there are some tactics about running at full speed etc when close to half time.
	
Substitutes
-----------
- If a player is injured in a foul, can you substitute another?
  - Inclined to say No.	
  

Direction
---------
- Should AIs provide the direction in degrees or as a vector?
- Or provide a destination "intention".
  - AIs will almost certainly have a destination in mind.
  - So providing a direction is a bit weird.
  - They will have to translate this into a direction,
    then the engine has to translate this back into a vector

- The AI could specify a destination.
  - Intentions could be in a private part of the state.
  - The destination could be translated into a vector when moving the player
    - (We'll have to calculate this anyway to move them.)
	- This vector is shown to everyone.


Players pass through each other?
--------------------------------
- Maybe players should be able to pass through each other?
  - It would make the game a lot simpler.
  - Avoid player collision detection, blocking and so on.
- Interaction would have to be deliberate
  - e.g. tackling, fouling etc.


Kick off rules
--------------
From Wikipedia:
"The kick-off is taken from the center spot. All players must be in their own half of
the field of play, and all opposing players must remain at least 10 yards (9.16m) from
the ball (a distance marked on the pitch by the centre circle), until the ball is in play.

The ball is initially stationary until it is put into play. The ball is in play when it
is kicked and moves forward. The player who has first kicked the ball may not touch it
again until it has been touched by another player. Because of this, play is almost
always started with two players at the center spot - one to kick the ball forward a few
inches, and the second to pass the ball backwards to the rest of the team."

- Do we want to do the same?
  - I think we do want to have the thing about opponents being 10m away.
  - Not so sure about the first player to kick rule.



Game ticks and the State Machine
--------------------------------
- When does the state machine change state?
  - On all events (updates from AIs etc)
  - Or just on *time*

- Might be easier on time

- The current state manages the current tick
  - It knows when it has received both AI responses (if required)
  - So the current state knows when it is possible to move to the next tick.

- GSM_Manager has an onTimerTick method.
  - This is the only method that changes the state
  - Other methods are just updates for internal processing.
  - First thing a State does here is check the game for relevant changes
    - Such as goals etc
    - Returns a new State if necessary

- Other events can call Game.nextTick()
  - This triggers a timer (nanotimer)
  - OR: process.nextTick() if in simulation mode

- Game has a GSM_Manager
  - It can call into it when the timer ticks

- Really what we are trying to make is a game loop.
  - But it needs to be asynchronous to fit with the node.js ethos
  - If it was a "real" game loop we would:
    - Perform actions based on current positions (kicking, tackling, taking possession etc)
    - Update positions of players and the ball
    - Send update to the GUI
    - Send game state to the AIs
    - Get AI responses, based on current positions etc
    - Sleep / advance game time
    - Loop round

  - In an event / callback model this looks like:
    - Game.onTurn (ie, each "turn" of the game, ie each time slice)
      - Perform actions
      - Update positions
      - Check game events (half-time, goal etc)
      - Call into GSM.checkState
      - Send update to the GUI
      - Send update to the AIs (event:START_OF_TURN), ie the game state, but not a request
      - Call into GSM.onTurn

    - GSM.checkState
      - This is handled by the specific State objects
      - Checks state and returns new state if necessary

    - GSM.onTurn
      - This is handled by the specific State objects (which might have changed since the call the checkState)
      - Sends a request to the AIs
        - As the info has been sent by the Game, this can be quite short maybe just "request":"PLAY"

    - [Async wait for AIs to respond]

    - GSM.onResponsesReceived
      - Handled by the specific State objects.
      - Updates the game objects (teams, players etc)
      - Call into Game.playNextTurn
        - Advances game time
        - This either sets a timer, or process.nextTick to call Game.onTurn



- When do we change state?
  - Is it the State that knows when state changes?
  - (If not, then why have states at all?)
  - Let's say it is the State
  - What about Half Time, or End of Game?
    - These are handled by Game.onTurn
  - GSM.checkState
    - Checks for change of state and returns the new state to Manager
    - Then Game.onTurn calls GSM.onTurn


- Note: Some GSM states will send an event when we enter them to tell the
        AIs that we have moved into a new state, e.g. started penalties,
        started free-kick etc. Including "start normal play"
