Power ups
---------
- The game could have power-ups that randomly appear. They could give you:
  - Extra stamina
  - Extra speed
  - Extra skill
  - New abilities, e.g. bend-it-like-Beckham


How many players?
-----------------
- Too many might make it hard to see things in a GUI.
- So five or six players?
- Let's say five.


API / interaction thoughts
--------------------------
- AIs set a destination for each player, and the speed they want to move at
  - Speed depends on their speed-ability and on their energy.


Skills & abilities
------------------
- Passing accuracy
- Curl "Bend it like Beckham"
- Ball control (controlling a ball passed to you or intercepted)
- Tackling
- Speed
- Stamina
- Turning speed (A more general 'agility' ability? Would it be used for anything else?)


Initial allocation of abilities
-------------------------------
- 100 points in each ability
- Is this enough? 
  - Even distribution would give 20 points in each ability to each player.
  - If 100 = perfect ability (e.g passing) then an average of 20% would be too low.
- Answer: The 100 total (per ability) can be changed.
  - So 100 = 100% accuracy
- Less accuracy could make the games more interesting.
  - More random anyway. Not sure whether this is good or bad.
  - Even so: ability counts for something overall.


Passing accuracy
----------------
- 100% (100 points) accuracy means 


Turning
-------
- Players are facing in a direction
- When they want to run in a direction they must turn first
- This takes some time, depending on their agility
- For passing and shooting, there could be an option to do so without turning.
  - This reduces the accuracy, depending on the angle.


Size of the pitch
-----------------
- The goal should be wider than the sum of the players!
  - Even if the players are spread out, the ball should be able to get through to the goal.
- Size in "units"
- Should we store values as doubles or integers?
  - Doubles would be easier for calculations.


Cheats
------
- Fouling
- Diving
- Biting
- The Hand of God
- They all give you some advantage, if you get away with them.

Hard tackle
-----------
- When tackling a player, you have the option to specify a hard tackle.
  - This gives you a greater chance of getting the ball.
  - But also gives a greater chance of committing a foul.


Fouls
-----
- Deliberate fouls using the fouling API
- Bashing into another player
  - Not quite sure how to decide which player is guilty
- Impeding progress



Sprint
------
- Ability to sprint for a short while (quite limited) which drains energy faster
- A way to break away from a marker.


Marking
-------
- How do we stop people just marking others incredibly closely?
- Is there anything to stop them just sticking together?
  - (What stops this in real football?)
- This will be ok
  - Because AIs see the current position every second, so there is a one second reaction time
  - Also, players will have different speeds.


Controlling destinations / intentions
-------------------------------------
- Should the API let AIs control the "intention" of each player
  - Its destination and action
- Or should AIs control the second-by-second action of each player
  - e.g. Run in X direction at Y speed
  - This seems better
- How will tackling work?
  - It may be impossible to tackle without "intention"
  - If it was just "tackle in X direction" you would most likely miss.
  - On the other hand, if you can just say "tackle player 3" at any time, this is too easy.
  - So maybe you can say "tackle player 3"
    - But only if you are close to them.


Changing direction
------------------
- When you say to run in a certain direction at a certain speed, what happens if you are not 
  currently facing that direction?
  - 1: You first turn (which takes an amount of time depending on your agility)
  - 2: You turn as you move.

- For 2: You always move in the direction you are facing, at your current speed.
  - You turn at your turning speed.
  - So you move in an arc.
  - I rather like this.    


Physics 10x faster than AI updates?
-----------------------------------
- We need to make sure we detect collisions.
  - Ball -->   <-- Player
  - If they are going too fast, then they could "go through" each other, if we
    don't check often enough.
  - (Or we could try to be clever!)
  - If we know the maximum speed of the ball and players, then we know the max combined speed.
    So we can make sure we calculate fast enough to ensure collision detection.
