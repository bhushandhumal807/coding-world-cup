Taking possession of the ball
-----------------------------

- action:TAKE_POSSESSION

- Only applies if the ball is moving freely.

- If the ball is owned you must tackle the player
  - Because then you specify how hard

- You can only issue the command if you are within 5m of the ball
  - Well: you can issue it any time, but it will be cancelled if you are over 5m away

- The action is cancelled if:
  - The ball moves over 5m away
  - Another player takes possession of the ball

- You can only actually take possession if you are within 0.5m of the ball
  - When you are further away, the action makes you run towards the ball at full speed
  - In the calculation loop
    - The ball moves first
    - Then player actions are performed

- Whether you get the ball depends on:
  - The player's ballControlAbility
  - The relative speed of the player and the ball
  - A random factor based on the above points

- Relative speed
  - Means we need to know the actual speed of the player and the ball
  - We've got the speed of the ball
  - We need it for the player
    - Add to dynamic state
    - Only has a value when moving (ie, set to zero when MOVE ends)
  - Some sort of vector combination?
  - NO: See below

- BUT: Should you run towards the ball at full speed if not near it?
  - That might make the relative speed thing go a bit weird.
  - Let's say Yes (you do run at full speed)
    - And we just look at the speed of the ball
