TODO: Test that player slows down as energy runs down

TODO: Test that energy does not go below zero (and player does not go backwards!)

TODO: Test recuperation of energy

TODO: Test that errors in parsing responses get sent to the correct AI. If the only try...catch is at the handler level, then the second handler may get all errors (as it is only then that parsing takes place).

TODO: Test multiple players trying to take possession

TODO: Test taking possession of a moving ball

TODO: Test of more than one player tackling

TODO: Test of kickoff positions
