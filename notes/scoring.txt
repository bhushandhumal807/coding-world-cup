Scoring
-------
- A team scores if the ball goes into the opponent's goal (!)

- This means that the ball goes past the end-of-pitch line
  - Which means that the ball bounces
  - From x < 0 or x > WIDTH

- If it has bounced, we need to find the intersection with the x=0 line
  or x=WIDTH line
  - We want the y-value at the intersection
  - Then we see if this is between the goalposts
