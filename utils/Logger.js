/**
 * Logger
 * ------
 * This "logger" is really a log-broker.
 *
 * You register logging classes with it, which each implement
 * a log(message) method. When you log to this class, it forwards
 * the message to the registered brokers.
 *
 * This class manages log levels, formatting and indenting as well
 * as the collection of loggers.
