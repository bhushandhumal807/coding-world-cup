<h3>25-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    Happy Christmas!
</p>
<p>
    Some extra validation for the kick action. You cannot now kick with speed less than 0.0
    or greater than 100.0.
</p>
<p>
    I have removed the 'speed' field from the MOVE action. Without energy in the game, there was no
    point moving at less than full speed, and moving at variable speed had never been implemented
    properly. You do not need to change your code for this, but if you pass a 'speed' field it will
    be ignored.
</p>

<h3>24-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    The game-engine now forces abilities to be between 0.0 and 100.0. Previously you could specify
    abilities less than 0.0 or greater than 100.0.
</p>

<h3>20-Dec-2104</h3>
<p>
    Some enhancements to the GUI: showing player numbers and the direction players are
    facing. Also, now draws the ball on top of the players, so that it it can't get 'lost'.
</p>


<h3>17-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    Added a simple GUI. See: <a href="gui.html">Running the GUI</a>.
</p>


<h3>15-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    Added the game length in seconds to the GAME_START event.
</p>
<p>
    The AI name is now used as the team name. There is no change to the API for this, as the
    team name was always sent, though previously it was an empty string.
</p>


<h3>14-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    Fixed the bug which gave an advantage to team 2.
</p>


<h3>13-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    Running from a command-line no longer shows the AI's stdout in the console. Only the output from the
    game-engine is now shown.
</p>


<h3>12-Dec-2014</h3>
<p>
    Updated the <a href="install_framework.html">'installing the framework'</a> page, to include a workaround
    for npm not working correctly with the current installation of node.js.
</p>
<p>
    Added notes about installing .NET 4 as needed by the C# BootAndShoot sample.
</p>
